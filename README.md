# Aap

The code for the data enhancement part comes from CLIP and [unidiffuser](https://github.com/thu-ml/unidiffuser)

We need a little more time to write a detailed reproduction guide, so please refer to [missing-aware-prompts](https://github.com/YiLunLee/missing_aware_prompts) before doing so.

Most of our code references are from [missing-aware-promt](https://github.com/YiLunLee/missing_aware_prompts) and [vilt](https://github.com/dandelin/ViLT)
